And that was only supposed to be an introduction! Thank you!

Recommended links:

* [The official docs](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
* [Basarat's Book](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/why-typescript.html)
* [TypeScript playground interactive examples](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?e=17#example/any)

On a future chapter maybe:

* Domain specific things; React + TS? node + TS?
* Writing type definitions.
