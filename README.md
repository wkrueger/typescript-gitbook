# A crash guide to Typescript

This aims a reader who already has some modern JS experience and is curious about TS. Special focus is given on presenting how the type system works.

What will we go through:

* What is typescript for? What typescript isn't. Why. Why not;
* Set it up as simply as possible;
* Type system overview;
* Caveats from someone used to JavaScript;
